# Biohackers-Series-Font
WARING! This is nowhere near perfect and was made in a few days by a beginner.

WARING! This font is not offically made by the Biohackers team but by a huge fan of the series.


This font only has upper case letters.
This font was made using Krita, Inkscape, and FontForge I have included the FontForge project file if anyone wishs to improve this font. This font is based on the font found in the opening of the Germen Netflix series Biohackers.
