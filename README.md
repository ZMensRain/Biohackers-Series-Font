# Biohackers-Series-Font
WARING! This is nowhere near perfect and was made in a few days by a beginner.

WARING! This font is not offically made by the Biohackers team but by a huge fan of the series.


This font only has upper case letters and a large amount of space between letters when the font size is below 40pt.
The edges are semi blury because the letters were made in Krita and then converted to svgs online.
This font was made using Krita, Inkscape, and FontForge I have included the FontForge project file if anyone wishs to inprove
this font.
